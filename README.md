Compiling it yourself 
=================
This method only allows you to compile on Windows. I'm not sure how you'd go about compiling it on Linux sorry.

1. Ensure you have PSP SDK installed. (I recommend the latest minimalist SDK)
2. Make sure you've set your envoirnemt variables to PSPSDK
3. Install OsLib Mod v2 from here https://github.com/dogo/oslibmodv2
4. Run compile.bat
